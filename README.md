Work in progress üë∑  
My attempt at some linear algebra and collision detection between points in 3D space.  
Built with C# and [Monogame](https://monogame.net/).  

* Transitions/animations when switching shapes
* Camera: drag, zoom and rotate
* Random 3D-effects
* Multiple effects and animations can run simultaneously

## Requirements
* A computer! (windows)
* [.NET 9.0 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet)
