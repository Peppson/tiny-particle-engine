My attempt at some linear algebra and collision detection between points in 3D-space.   
Built with C# and [Monogame](https://monogame.net/).  

* Shoot asteroids from the mouse pointer
* Transitions, Animations and 3D-effects
* Camera controls: Zoom, Rotate, and Pan
* Multiple effects/animations/asteroids can run simultaneously
