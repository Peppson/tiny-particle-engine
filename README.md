# tiny-particle-engine ☄️

My attempt at some linear algebra and collision detection between points in 3D-space.   
Built with C# and [Monogame](https://monogame.net/).  

* Shot asteroids from any angle
* Transitions, Animations and 3D-effects
* Camera controls: Zoom, Rotate, and Pan
* Fully dynamic: Multiple effects/animations/asteroids can run simultaneously

## Requirements
* A computer! (Windows)
* [.NET 9.0 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet)
